# VASTTracker

The `VASTTracker` class provides methods to track the execution of an Ad.

* [Constructor](#constructor)
* [Events](#events)
* [Methods](#methods)

## Constructor<a name="constructor"></a>

The constructor signature is:
```Javascript
constructor(client, ad, creative, variation = null)
```
#### Parameters
 * **`client: VASTClient`** - An optional instance of VASTClient that can be updated by the tracker.
 * **`ad: Ad`** - The ad to track
 * **`creative: Creative`** - The creative to track
 * **`variation: CompanionAd|NonLinearAd`** - An optional variation of the creative, for Companion and NonLinear Ads

#### Example
To get an instance of `VASTTracker`, simply import it and create one using the constructor:
```Javascript
import {
  VASTClient,
  VASTTracker
} from 'vast-client'

// With a client instance
const vastClient = new VASTClient();
const vastTracker = new VASTTracker(vastClient, ad, creative);
// For a companion ad
const vastTracker = new VASTTracker(vastClient, ad, creative, companion);

// Without a client instance
const vastTracker = new VASTTracker(null, ad, creative);
```

## Events<a name="events"></a>
`VASTTracker` extends [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter), therefore is possible to add event listeners like this:
```Javascript
vastTracker.on('exitFullscreen', () => {
  // Deal with the event
});
```

Here is the list of events emitted by the class:
 * **`complete`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted after `complete()` has been called.
 * **`clickthrough`** - Emitted when calling `click()` if there is at least one <clickThroughURLTemplate> element. A URL will be passed as a data
 * **`close`** - Only for non-linear ads, emitted when `close()` is called
 * **`closeLinear`** - Only for linear ads, emitted when `close()` is called
 * **`creativeView`** - Emitted after `load()` method has been called.
 * **`exitFullscreen`** - Emitted when calling `setFullscreen(fullscreen)` and changing the fullscreen state from true to false
 * **`firstQuartile`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted when the adunit has reached 25% of its duration
 * **`fullscreen`** - Emitted when calling `setFullscreen(fullscreen)` and changing the fullscreen state from false to true
 * **`midpoint`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted when the adunit has reached 50% of its duration
 * **`mute`** - Emitted when calling `setMuted(muted)` and changing the mute state from false to true
 * **`pause`** - Emitted when calling `setPaused(paused)` and changing the pause state from false to true
 * **`progress-[0-100]%`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted on every `setProgress(duration)` calls, where [0-100] is the adunit percentage completion
 * **`progress-[currentTime]`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted on every `setProgress(duration)` calls, where [currentTime] is the adunit current time
 * **`resume`** - Emitted when calling `setPaused(paused)` and changing the pause state from true to false
 * **`rewind`** - Emitted when `setProgress(duration)` is called with a smaller duration than the previous one
 * **`skip`** - Emitted after calling `skip()`
 * **`skip-countdown`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted on every `setProgress(duration)` calls, the updated countdown will be passed as a data
 * **`start`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted on the 1st non-null `setProgress(duration)` call
 * **`thirdQuartile`** - Only for linear ads with a duration. Emitted when the adunit has reached 75% of its duration
 * **`unmute`** - Emitted when calling `setMuted(muted)` and changing the mute state from true to false

### setSkipDelay(duration)
Must be called if you want to overwrite the `<Linear> Skipoffset` value. This will init the skip countdown duration. Then, every time `setProgress()` is called, it will decrease the countdown and emit a `skip-countdown` event with the remaining time.
